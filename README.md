Program to change macbook air's display brightness

As you may be aware, macbook air has a brightness bug on linux - backlight switches only between max brightness and 0 brightness after a suspend-resume operation. This is a cloned code with which I am testing alternatives other than bitbanging on the intel backlight driver chip.

Feel free to pick in.

Cheers,
